Bio
---------

I am Chi Feng 馮馳, a graduate student in the PhD program in Chinese. My research covers a wide range of early Chinese literature and thought, and I am particularly interested how people “make” musical instruments by writing about them. The material I use include early songs, narratives, philosophical treatise, ritual accounts, and music theory, which are written in various forms, as well as early musical instruments themselves. Before coming to IU, I got my bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Tongji University, Shanghai (2019), and master’s degrees in Chinese (2022) and in Religious Studies (2022) from the University of Colorado, Boulder. I am also a part-time musician. I am actively engaged in music performance, and I enjoy studying classical music around the world. Swimming is also among my favorites!
